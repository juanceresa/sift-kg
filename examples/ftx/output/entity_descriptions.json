  "organization:ftx": "FTX, founded by Samuel Benjamin Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang in April 2019, rapidly grew to become the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, boasting over one million users at its peak. The company, initially headquartered in Hong Kong, relocated to the Bahamas in September 2021, citing a favorable regulatory environment. However, in November 2022, FTX faced a catastrophic solvency crisis, leading to its bankruptcy filing alongside Alameda Research and over 100 affiliated entities in Delaware.\n\nThe collapse of FTX was marked by significant financial mismanagement and alleged fraudulent activities. During the 2022 bankruptcy proceedings, it was disclosed that FTX had loaned $55 million to Ryan Salame, a move that raised questions about the company's financial practices. The funds misappropriated from FTX were primarily stablecoins, which were quickly converted to Ether, complicating recovery efforts. This financial turmoil drew comparisons to the infamous collapses of Lehman Brothers and Enron, illustrating the scale and impact of FTX's downfall.\n\nIn the wake of the bankruptcy, John J. Ray III was appointed CEO to navigate the complex legal and financial landscape, charging $1,300 per hour with a $200,000 retainer fee. Meanwhile, FTX filed a lawsuit in November 2024 against Binance Holdings Ltd., Changpeng Zhao, and other Binance executives, following Binance's aborted acquisition attempt of FTX's non-US operations in November 2022. This legal battle revealed the contentious relationships within the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFTX's extensive network included over 130 international affiliates and ownership of assets like Embed Financial Technologies and the naming rights to FTX Arena. The exchange also engaged in high-profile partnerships, such as with Major League Baseball and the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team, further embedding its brand in global markets. Despite its ambitious reach and valuation of $32 billion in November 2022, FTX's rapid ascent was ultimately overshadowed by its dramatic collapse.",
  "person:sam_bankman_fried": "Sam Bankman-Fried founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in April 2019 alongside Gary Wang, aiming to generate revenue to support Alameda Research, a trading firm he co-founded with Tara MacAulay. Bankman-Fried's ventures quickly propelled him to significant wealth, with his net worth reaching $16 billion before the collapse of FTX in 2022. However, his empire crumbled when he was found guilty of defrauding customers of FTX and lenders of Alameda Research, leading to his arrest in the Bahamas on December 12, 2022.\n\nBankman-Fried's downfall began with the massive fraud that led to the collapse of FTX in 2022. He resigned as CEO on November 11, 2022, and was succeeded by Ray. Despite the bankruptcy filing for FTX and Alameda, Bankman-Fried attempted to raise funds to salvage the firm. His legal troubles escalated when he was charged by the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York with fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the US and violate campaign finance laws.\n\nOn November 2, 2023, Bankman-Fried was convicted of all charges related to the fraud, and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison on March 28, 2024. His conviction also included a forfeiture amount of $11 billion. Throughout this period, Bankman-Fried maintained his innocence, pleading not guilty during his arraignment in Manhattan on January 3, 2023. Despite his legal battles, Bankman-Fried's influence and connections within the cryptocurrency and philanthropic communities, including affiliations with Solana and the FTX Future Fund, were significant until his conviction.",

Binance's holdings included 23 million FTT tokens, valued at approximately $529 million in early November 2022, which it received as part of a sale of its equity in FTX in 2021. However, Binance's relationship with FTX soured, leading to a nonbinding agreement to purchase FTX, which Binance withdrew the following day.\n\nBinance's expansion included acquiring Trust Wallet in July 2018 and the Indian bitcoin exchange WazirX in November 2019. The company also invested in various projects, such as raising $65 million for Chiliz and $32 million for the Terra stablecoin project. Binance's partnerships extended to Simplex, an Israel-based payment processor, and it took a $200 million stake in Forbes in February 2022.\n\nRegulatory challenges have been a constant for Binance. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance to cease all regulated activities in June 2021, and Italy's Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa blocked its operations. Despite these hurdles, Binance registered to operate in Spain in July 2022 and Sweden in January 2023.

His business acumen led him to purchase a 20% stake in FTX for approximately $100 million, further intertwining his interests with those of Bankman-Fried.\n\nZhao's career has been marked by significant achievements and controversies. In 2013, he joined Blockchain.info as a team member, contributing to the development of the cryptocurrency wallet. His leadership at Binance saw the launch of Binance Coin and Binance Smart Chain, expanding the company's influence in the digital asset space. However, his tenure as CEO was not without challenges; he agreed to pay a $50 million fine and stepped down as CEO, although he retained ownership of Binance.\n\nIn October 2025, Zhao received a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, following lobbying efforts that cost $800,000. This pardon came after Zhao served a four-month prison sentence, concluding in September 2024. Despite these legal hurdles, Zhao continued to exert influence in the cryptocurrency industry, advising the Pakistan Ministry of Finance and the president of Kyrgyzstan, Sadyr Japarov, on digital asset development.\n\nZhao's personal and professional life is closely linked with Yi He, his business partner and life partner, with whom he co-founded Binance.

He was accused of transferring at least $4 billion from FTX to Alameda Research, actions that contributed to the financial instability of both companies. Bankman-Fried's influence extended beyond Alameda, as he was also deeply involved in the operations of FTX, where he was the chief executive.\n\nThe collapse of Alameda Research and FTX marked a significant event in the cryptocurrency industry, with Bankman-Fried and other senior leaders reportedly worth approximately $16.5 billion prior to the downfall.
