Her cooperation with authorities was part of a plea deal that led to her sentencing on September 24, 2024, to two years in prison.

However, in November 2022, FTX faced a catastrophic solvency crisis, leading to its bankruptcy filing alongside Alameda Research and over 100 affiliated entities in Delaware.\n\nThe collapse of FTX was marked by significant financial mismanagement and alleged fraudulent activities. During the 2022 bankruptcy proceedings, it was disclosed that FTX had loaned $55 million to Ryan Salame, a move that raised questions about the company\u0027s financial practices. The funds misappropriated from FTX were primarily stablecoins, which were quickly converted to Ether, complicating recovery efforts. This financial turmoil drew comparisons to the infamous collapses of Lehman Brothers and Enron, illustrating the scale and impact of FTX\u0027s downfall.\n\nIn the wake of the bankruptcy, John J. Ray III was appointed CEO to navigate the complex legal and financial landscape, charging $1,300 per hour with a $200,000 retainer fee. Meanwhile, FTX filed a lawsuit in November 2024 against Binance Holdings Ltd., Changpeng Zhao, and other Binance executives, following Binance\u0027s aborted acquisition attempt of FTX\u0027s non-US operations in November 2022. This legal battle revealed the contentious relationships within the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFTX\u0027s extensive network included over 130 international affiliates and ownership of assets like Embed Financial Technologies and the naming rights to FTX Arena.

Founded by Changpeng Zhao, Binance initially operated out of China before relocating to Japan and then Malta due to regulatory pressures. Despite its global reach, Binance faced legal challenges, including a lawsuit filed by FTX against Binance and Zhao in November 2024.\n\nIn its early years, Binance raised $15 million through an initial coin offering and began trading just 11 days after its launch. By April 2018, it was recognized as the world\u0027s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Binance\u0027s holdings included 23 million FTT tokens, valued at approximately $529 million in early November 2022, which it received as part of a sale of its equity in FTX in 2021. However, Binance\u0027s relationship with FTX soured, leading to a nonbinding agreement to purchase FTX, which Binance withdrew the following day.\n\nBinance\u0027s expansion included acquiring Trust Wallet in July 2018 and the Indian bitcoin exchange WazirX in November 2019. The company also invested in various projects, such as raising $65 million for Chiliz and $32 million for the Terra stablecoin project. Binance\u0027s partnerships extended to Simplex, an Israel-based payment processor, and it took a $200 million stake in Forbes in February 2022.\n\nRegulatory challenges have been a constant for Binance. The UK\u0027s Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance to cease all regulated activities in June 2021, and Italy\u0027s Commissione Nazionale per le Societ\u00e0 e la Borsa blocked its operations. Despite these hurdles, Binance registered to operate in Spain in July 2022 and Sweden in January 2023.

In 2013, he joined Blockchain.info as a team member, contributing to the development of the cryptocurrency wallet. His leadership at Binance saw the launch of Binance Coin and Binance Smart Chain, expanding the company\u0027s influence in the digital asset space. However, his tenure as CEO was not without challenges; he agreed to pay a $50 million fine and stepped down as CEO, although he retained ownership of Binance.\n\nIn October 2025, Zhao received a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, following lobbying efforts that cost $800,000. This pardon came after Zhao served a four-month prison sentence, concluding in September 2024. Despite these legal hurdles, Zhao continued to exert influence in the cryptocurrency industry, advising the Pakistan Ministry of Finance and the president of Kyrgyzstan, Sadyr Japarov, on digital asset development.\n\nZhao\u0027s personal and professional life is closely linked with Yi He, his business partner and life partner, with whom he co-founded Binance.

As a former executive at FTX, Salame was deeply involved in the company\u0027s operations, serving as co-CEO and CEO of its Bahamian subsidiary, FTX Digital Markets. His legal troubles culminated in a sentencing in May 2024, where he received a 7.5-year federal prison sentence, with a restitution order exceeding $5 million and a forfeiture of $6 million. He began serving his sentence in October 2024 at FCI Cumberland in Maryland.\n\nSalame\u0027s financial dealings came under scrutiny during the 2022 FTX bankruptcy proceedings, revealing a $55 million loan from the company. His political activities also attracted attention; he founded the American Dream Federal Action super PAC and donated millions to Republican candidates during the 2022 United States elections. These actions led to his guilty plea for campaign finance violations. Additionally, in April 2023, the FBI raided his Potomac, Maryland home, further intensifying the investigation into his activities.\n\nBefore his legal issues, Salame had a promising career trajectory. He earned a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting from the Isenberg School of Management and a Bachelor of Arts in economics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2015. He later completed a master\u0027s in finance at Georgetown University\u0027s McDonough School of Business in 2019. His professional journey included a brief stint at Ernst \u0026 Young and a role at Alameda Research LLC in Hong Kong in 2019.\n\nSalame\u0027s personal life also intersected with his professional endeavors. His girlfriend, Michelle Bond, received $400,000 in consulting fees from FTX Digital Markets. Additionally, he purchased a five-bedroom Bahamian penthouse, which was notably occupied by Sam Bankman-Fried, another key figure in the FTX saga. Despite his legal challenges, Salame maintained his innocence in a YouTube interview with Tucker Carlson, who publicly supported him.", "entity_type": "PERSON", "font": {"color": "#e0e0e0"},

trading firm co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried and Tara MacAulay in 2017, initially operated out of Berkeley, California, before relocating to Hong Kong in early 2019. The firm, which was closely affiliated with the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was deeply involved in the financial dealings that led to a major insolvency crisis. Alameda Research owed FTX approximately $10 billion, as FTX had lent funds placed on the exchange for trading to Alameda. This financial entanglement was a critical factor in the collapse of both entities.\n\nCaroline Ellison, who led Alameda Research as the CEO, was at the helm during a tumultuous period that culminated in the firm\u0027s bankruptcy declaration on November 11, 2022. This filing was part of a larger Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection process that included FTX and over 130 affiliated entities. Prior to its collapse, Alameda Research had been involved in significant financial activities, including a $1 billion loan to Bankman-Fried and a $5 million donation to Future Forward USA, a political action committee supporting President Joe Biden during the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, who owned approximately 90 percent of Alameda Research as of August 2021, was a central figure in the firm\u0027s operations. He was accused of transferring at least $4 billion from FTX to Alameda Research, actions that contributed to the financial instability of both companies. Bankman-Fried\u0027s influence extended beyond Alameda, as he was also deeply involved in the operations of FTX, where he was the chief executive.\n\nThe collapse of Alameda Research and FTX marked a significant event in the cryptocurrency industry, with Bankman-Fried and other senior leaders reportedly worth approximately $16.5 billion prior to the downfall. The financial mismanagement and alleged misappropriation of funds led to a series of legal challenges, including Alameda Research\u0027s involvement as a plaintiff in the Insiders Avoidance Complaint.
