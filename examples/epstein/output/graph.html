His private jet, a Gulfstream 4, facilitated the transportation of victims and associates, including Maxwell and Giuffre, to various locations for illicit activities. Epstein\u0027s Palm Beach mansion at 358 El Brillo Way functioned as a hub for these operations, where he employed individuals like Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson, who were implicated in unlawful sexual activities with minors.\n\nDespite the gravity of the allegations, Epstein managed to evade deposition in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case, as the plaintiff failed to demonstrate sufficient cause. His legal team, including attorney Jack Goldberger, actively defended him against mounting accusations. Epstein\u0027s influence and wealth allowed him to maintain a network of enablers and associates, such as Leslie Wexner, who provided logistical support through resources like private planes.\n\nEpstein\u0027s predatory behavior was not limited to his residences; he also exploited his connections to powerful figures, including former President Bill Clinton, to bolster his social standing and shield his criminal activities.
