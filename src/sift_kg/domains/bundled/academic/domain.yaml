  Domain for mapping the intellectual landscape of a research area.
  Optimized for literature reviews, topic mapping, and understanding
  how concepts, theories, methods, and findings connect across a body
  of academic work. Feed in papers and get a graph of ideas.

system_context: |
  You are analyzing academic papers and research documents to map the
  intellectual landscape of a research area. Your goal is to extract the
  structure of ideas — not bibliometric metadata like citation counts,
  h-indices, or institutional affiliations.

  Focus on these relationship patterns:
  - Which theories EXPLAIN which phenomena or findings
  - Which findings SUPPORT or CONTRADICT which theories
  - Which methods are USED to produce which findings
  - Which concepts, theories, or methods EXTEND or BUILD ON earlier ones
  - Which researchers PROPOSED key theories, methods, or findings
  - How ideas connect across different fields and subfields

  When naming entities, prefer canonical forms: use the established name
  of a theory ("Dual Process Theory" not "the dual process account"),
  the standard term for a method ("grounded theory" not "GT approach"),
  and concise labels for findings ("bilingual cognitive advantage" not
  "the finding that bilingual individuals show improved executive function").

entity_types:
  CONCEPT:
    description: "Core ideas, constructs, variables, and technical terms central to the research area"
    extraction_hints:
      - "Look for defined terms, key variables, and constructs that papers build arguments around"
      - "Include both broad concepts (e.g. 'cognitive load') and specific operationalizations"
      - "Capture the definition or description when the text provides one"
      - "Use CONCEPT for ideas that don't have a named theoretical framework — if it has a proper name and makes predictions, use THEORY instead"

  THEORY:
    description: "Named theoretical frameworks, models, paradigms, and schools of thought"
    extraction_hints:
      - "Look for named theories, frameworks, and models (e.g. 'Actor-Network Theory', 'Dual Process Model')"
      - "Include paradigms and schools of thought (e.g. 'constructivism', 'positivism')"
      - "Note the originator or key proponents when mentioned"
      - "Must have a proper name — 'Cognitive Load Theory' is a THEORY, 'cognitive load' is a CONCEPT"

  METHOD:
    description: "Research methods, techniques, analytical approaches, and tools"
    extraction_hints:
      - "Include study designs (RCT, case study, ethnography), analysis techniques (regression, thematic analysis), and instruments"
      - "Capture software tools and platforms when they are central to the methodology"
      - "Note sample sizes, populations, or conditions when they define the methodological approach"

  FINDING:
    description: "Key results, conclusions, effects, and empirical observations reported in studies"
    extraction_hints:
      - "Look for stated results, reported effects, and conclusions drawn from data"
      - "Capture effect sizes, statistical significance, and directionality when mentioned"
      - "Include null results and negative findings — these matter for the landscape"
      - "Name findings as concise canonical labels, not full sentences (e.g. 'bilingual cognitive advantage' not 'bilingual individuals show improved executive function')"
      - "If a finding has an established name (e.g. 'replication crisis', 'Mozart effect'), use that name"

  PHENOMENON:
    description: "Observable events, behaviors, patterns, or problems that research investigates"
    extraction_hints:
      - "Look for the thing being studied — the real-world behavior, pattern, trend, or problem"
      - "PHENOMENON is something observable in the world; CONCEPT is an abstract idea used to reason about it; THEORY is a named framework that explains it"
      - "Examples: 'urban heat island effect', 'antibiotic resistance', 'voter turnout decline'"
      - "'Climate change' is a PHENOMENON; 'greenhouse effect' is a CONCEPT; 'Anthropogenic Global Warming Theory' is a THEORY"

  RESEARCHER:
    description: "Individual academics referenced as key contributors to ideas, not just listed authors"
    extraction_hints:
      - "Extract researchers who are credited with originating a theory, coining a term, or producing a landmark finding"
      - "Skip routine author mentions — focus on people whose names are attached to ideas"
      - "Note their contribution: 'proposed X', 'demonstrated Y', 'coined the term Z'"

  PUBLICATION:
    description: "Specific papers, books, or reports referenced as important sources"
    extraction_hints:
      - "Extract publications that are discussed substantively, not just cited in passing"
      - "Include landmark papers, seminal books, and meta-analyses that shape the field"
      - "Capture the title or short identifier, year, and why it matters"

  FIELD:
    description: "Academic disciplines, subfields, and interdisciplinary areas"
    extraction_hints:
      - "Look for named disciplines and subfields (e.g. 'computational linguistics', 'behavioral economics')"
      - "Capture interdisciplinary bridges when research draws from multiple fields"
